    🚀 About Stick It In V3 – Club Edition 25/26
  </h1>
  <p>
    Stick It In V3 isn’t fantasy football — it’s a
    <strong>strategic prediction league</strong> built around
    <strong>digital club ownership</strong> and <strong>community-driven value creation</strong>.
    Only 20 clubs exist. Each is managed, valued, and—potentially—sold like a digital asset.
  </p>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #093759">🏟️ Built like a business</h2>
  <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6">
    <li>✅ <strong>You run a club</strong> — every decision affects your value and ranking.</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Prediction performance builds team worth</strong> — accuracy = growth.</li>
    <li>✅ <strong>Community consensus fuels the ecosystem</strong> — shared wins = rising pot.</li>
    <li>
      ✅ <strong>Real buy-out offers</strong> at the end of the season based on your club’s value.
    </li>
    <li>
      ✅ <strong>Mid-season buyouts optional</strong> — listed clubs may receive offers via the
      public Team Directory.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #093759">⚙️ How the economy works</h2>
  <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6">
    <li>Predict 10 results + 10 BTTS calls each week (Mon–Fri).</li>
    <li>Game Entry closes Friday 23:59. No edits during live match weekends.</li>
    <li>Points are earned for accuracy — boosting your club’s weight and reputation.</li>
    <li>A performance-weighted value is calculated weekly — your team is a growing asset.</li>
    <li>The stronger the community’s collective accuracy, the higher the shared prize pool.</li>
    <li>🛒 Action Cards like Red Cards or Injuries can be bought (or earned) to disrupt rivals.</li>
    <li>
      🔻 Miss 3 full weeks and your club enters administration — it will be offered to a new
      manager.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #093759">💰 Value, rewards & legacy</h2>
  <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6">
    <li>📊 Club value is tracked publicly and updated weekly.</li>
    <li>🏆 On <strong>31 May 2026</strong>, buy-out offers are made based on team performance.</li>
    <li>💼 Mid-season offers are optional — listed clubs can be sold to waiting managers.</li>
    <li>🔐 Once sold, your value resets — you step aside for the new owner.</li>
    <li>🎯 Top finishers earn the highest returns — but every club has earning potential.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #093759">📩 How to claim a club</h2>
  <ul style="padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.6">
    <li>Take the timed football IQ quiz.</li>
    <li>Score 8/10 or better to join the shortlist.</li>
    <li>If selected, you’ll be invited to claim and manage a club for the season.</li>
    <li>First come first served.</li>
    <li>
      At the end of the season, you can choose to remain with your club or apply to take over
      another.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top: 30px; color: #093759">🧠 Why only 20 clubs?</h2>
  <p>
    Version 3 is about <strong>focus, ownership, and performance</strong>. No ghosts. No
    half-commitments. Just 20 strategic minds competing in a closed economy, where performance
    builds both <strong>status and stake</strong>.
